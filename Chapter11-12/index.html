        PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEAND COMPUTING
      </h2>
      <p>
        Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing
        (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-for-profit educational initiative
        started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia
        Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in
        emerging tech fields like
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h2 id="cnc">Cloud Native computing:</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students to program in
        open source technologies like,<em><strong> Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript,
        Node.js, React and React Native</strong></em> while introducing the students to
        development of Microservices and software developmenttechniques on cloud
        platforms like AWS.
      </p>
      <h2 id="ai">Artifical Intelligence:</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through
        the foundation of the AItechnology, via teaching programming in open
        source languages like<em><strong> Python, Numpy, Pandas,Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask</strong></em>,
        and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, andending
        with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
      </p>
      <h2 id="bc">Blockchain:</h2>
      <p>
        The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains
        like Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric), and learn to program in languages
        such as Solidity, JavaScript onframeworks like Node.js. The program also
        introduces them to development of Distributed Apps(DApps), frameworks
        like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of
        Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial
        Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token
      </p>
      <h2 id="iot">Internet of Things:</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Internet of things</strong> program introduces the students to open source
        development technologies like <strong><em>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper,
        Diesel, Google Assistant,and Kubernetes</em></strong> while making them efficient in
        developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoTCloud, and voice computing
        for device control.
